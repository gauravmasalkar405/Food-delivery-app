After requesting to change we were served by ultra uber staff named Kundan who graced us with his presence some 20 mins after we were seated. We saw him jumping around 2-3 more tables before he placed our order. The food came, without any crockery (forks spoons plates etc) we requested plates if not more then atleast 5-6 times each time we were ignored. The food kept coming in but no crockery. And finally when we lost our patience Dearest kundan told us that Starter is supposed to be eaten off starter plates üòÇüòÇ and if we had an issue we cud speak with manager. Never visiting this place again. Horrible.",
