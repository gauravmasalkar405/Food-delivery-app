They served wet Manchurian and also the rice was not cooked properly. The service is very slow. When we added to remove the service charge this Singh guy speaks as if he is doing us a favour and gets some rubbish documents saying service charge is mandatory as the law has been passed. We did pay the charge but these people are trying to fool the public by showing sone fake documents and speak as if they know the rules. I suggest no one should visit this place at all!!",

After requesting to change we were served by ultra uber staff named Kundan who graced us with his presence some 20 mins after we were seated. We saw him jumping around 2-3 more tables before he placed our order. The food came, without any crockery (forks spoons plates etc) we requested plates if not more then atleast 5-6 times each time we were ignored. The food kept coming in but no crockery. And finally when we lost our patience Dearest kundan told us that Starter is supposed to be eaten off starter plates 😂😂 and if we had an issue we cud speak with manager. Never visiting this place again. Horrible.",
